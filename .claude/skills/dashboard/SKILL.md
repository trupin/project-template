Show a quick project status dashboard. This is the "where are we?" skill — run it at the start of a session or when you need to orient.

## Gather Data

Collect all of the following in parallel (use multiple tool calls):

### A. Issue Status
Read `issues/PLAN.md` and count issues by status:
- `done` — completed
- `in_progress` — currently being worked on
- `todo` — waiting (distinguish between **ready** (all deps done) and **blocked** (deps pending))
- `blocked` — explicitly blocked with a reason

### B. Git State
Run these commands:
- `git status --short` — any uncommitted changes? Untracked files?
- `git log --oneline -5` — last 5 commits for context
- `git branch --show-current` — what branch are we on?
- If not on main: `git log main..HEAD --oneline` — how far ahead of main?

### C. Test Health (optional, fast-check only)
If the project has been configured (`.claude/project.configured` exists), check when tests were last run:
- Look at git log for the most recent commit message mentioning tests or a test-related issue.
- Do NOT run the full test suite — that's what `/test` is for. Just report when tests were last verified.

## Present the Dashboard

Format as a compact summary:

```
## Project Status

**Branch**: main (clean | 3 uncommitted files)
**Last commit**: [API-005] Add auth middleware — 2h ago

### Issues
| Status      | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| Done        | 12    |
| In Progress | 2     |
| Ready       | 3     |
| Blocked     | 1     |
| Todo (deps) | 5     |

### Ready to Implement
- API-008: Add rate limiting (P1)
- UI-004: Dashboard chart component (P1)
- CORE-006: Add caching layer (P2)

### In Progress
- ENGINE-003: Batch processing pipeline (agent: engine-dev)

### Blocked
- UI-005: Real-time updates — waiting on ENGINE-003

### Actionable Now
> Run `/implement next` to pick up API-008 (highest priority ready issue).
> Or `/implement all` to run the full batch (3 ready issues across 2 domains).
```

## Rules

- Keep it fast. This should take seconds, not minutes. No deep exploration.
- Always end with an actionable suggestion — what should the user do next?
- If the working tree is dirty, warn prominently: "**Warning: uncommitted changes from previous work. Commit or stash before starting new issues.**"
- If there are no ready issues and no in-progress issues, suggest `/decompose` or `/issue create` to queue up new work.
