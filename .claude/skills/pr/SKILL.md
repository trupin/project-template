Create a pull request for the current branch.

## 1. Gather Context

Run in parallel:
- `git branch --show-current` — current branch name
- `git log main..HEAD --oneline` — commits on this branch (use `$ARGUMENTS` instead of `main` if a base branch was specified)
- `git diff main..HEAD --stat` — files changed
- `git status --short` — any uncommitted work?

If on `main` (no branch), warn: "You're on main. Create a branch first, or specify a base branch."

If there are uncommitted changes, warn: "There are uncommitted changes. Commit them first, or they won't be in the PR."

## 2. Identify Related Issues

Scan the commit messages for issue IDs (pattern: `[DOMAIN-NNN]`). For each unique issue ID found:
1. Read the issue file to get the title and summary.
2. Check if the issue status is `done`.

## 3. Generate PR Content

**Title**: If all commits relate to a single issue, use: `[ISSUE-ID] Issue title`. If multiple issues, use a brief summary of the overall change (under 70 characters).

**Body**: Generate using this structure:

```markdown
## Summary
<1-3 sentences describing the overall change>

## Issues Addressed
- [ISSUE-ID] Title — status
- [ISSUE-ID] Title — status

## Changes
<Bulleted list of key changes, grouped by domain if multi-domain>

## Test Plan
- [ ] `/test` passes
- [ ] `/lint` passes
- [ ] <any issue-specific verification steps from the issue files>
```

## 4. Push and Create

1. Check if the current branch has an upstream: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream}` — if not, push with `-u`.
2. Push to remote: `git push` (or `git push -u origin <branch>` if no upstream).
3. Create the PR:

```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<body content>

```

## 5. Report

Show the user:
- PR URL
- Title
- Number of commits and files changed
- Issues referenced

## Rules

- Never force-push. If the push fails, report the error and let the user decide.
- Never create a PR from `main` to `main`.
- If `gh` is not installed, tell the user to install it: `brew install gh && gh auth login`.
- If the branch is already associated with a PR, report that and offer to update it instead.
